# TaxuallyTest

The SignUpSubscriptions test is contains 6 steps of the trial task.

I got stuck with some cache problem on the site. As I see after some test run the linked (empty?) companies cached and conflict with the test execution.
I tried some manuvers for example RegisterNewBusiness() method but they were not working.

Unique locators for web elements would be great! (ID)
